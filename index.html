               <b>Avul Pakir Jainelabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> was the 11th President of the country from 2002 and 2007 
                and is also popularly known as the 'Missile Man' of India. Born in a poor family in Tamil 
                Nadu's Rameswaram, Kalam went on to study physics and aerospace engineering and worked with 
                Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation 
                (ISRO). He also played a role in 1998 Pokhran-II tests under leadership of Atar Bihar Vajpayee. 
                Abdul Kalam was felicitated with a Padma Bhushan in 1981, Padma Vibhushan in 1990 and then 
                received India's highest civilian honour Bharat Ratna in 1997. He is also known for a humble and
                respectful attitude towards people and was called the 'People's President'. After the end of his
                tenure as President of the country, he went back to delivering lectures to students and writing.
                He died after suffering cardiac arrest while delivering a lecture at Indian Institute of
                Management Shillong on July, 27, 2015. He was buried in his hometown Rameswaram with full 
                state honours.
